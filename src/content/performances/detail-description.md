Where no performane took place on that day (for instance during Easter or the long Summer closure), the column is blank. Where a performance took place at either or both of the theates, the column contains a bar, black for Covent Garden, white for Drury Lane, grey where the two intersect. The height of the bar indicates the box office receipts for the performance.
