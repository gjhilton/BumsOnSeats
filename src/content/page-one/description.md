Each row of this chart corresponds to a single year. Each row has 356/6 columns, each representing a single day of the year.

Where no performance took place on a given day (for instance during Easter or the long Summer closure between seasons), the column is blank. Where a performance took place at either or both of the theatres, the column contains a bar, blue for Covent Garden, red for Drury Lane, purple where the two intersect. The height of the bar indicates the box office receipts for the performance.
