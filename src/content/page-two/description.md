The charts on this page visualise data year by year.

The first chart shows the distribution of amounts received per performance for performances in each year. Note that we only include performances for which receipts data exists - performances without receipt data are excluded.

The second chart simplifies and consolidates the same information, just showing the mean receipt per performance per year (again including only performances for which we hold receipts data).

The final chart tallies the total number of performances per year, showing what proportion of the total count have data and have been included in the two visualisations above.
