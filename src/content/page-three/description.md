This page breaks down the data by day of the week (allowing for the move from the Julian to Gregorian calendar on 14 September 1752).

Sunday performances were virtually non-existent, with only 2 recorded instances out of 29,310 total performances (0.007%). The first, on 4 June 1809 at Drury Lane, was a benefit performance of *Critic*, *Devil to Pay*, and *Three & Deuce*, which took £148 and filled the house. The second, on 5 November 1809 (Guy Fawkes Night), shows *Grieving's a Folly* and *Mayor of Garratt* but records zero revenue and zero capacity—suggesting a data entry error?

The revenue and capacity charts below exclude 12,423 performances (42% of the dataset) that recorded zero for both revenue and capacity, as these likely represent gaps in the data rather than actual performances. However, the performance types chart includes all 29,310 recorded performances.
