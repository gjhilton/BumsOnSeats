This page breaks down the data by day of the week (allowing for the move from the Julian to Gregorian calendar on 14 September 1752).

Sunday performances were virtually non-existent due to religious prohibitions, with only 2 recorded instances out of 29,310 total performances (0.007%). The first, on 4 June 1809 at Drury Lane, was a benefit performance of *Critic*, *Devil to Pay*, and *Three & Deuce*, which took £148 and filled the house. The second, on 5 November 1809 (Guy Fawkes Night), shows *Grieving's a Folly* and *Mayor of Garratt* but records zero revenue and zero capacity—suggesting a data entry error?
